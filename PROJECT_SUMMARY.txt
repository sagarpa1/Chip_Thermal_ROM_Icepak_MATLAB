Physics-informed Reduced Order Thermal Model for High-Power Chip

This project combines ANSYS Icepak CFD and MATLAB regression to build a Reduced Order
Model (ROM) for rapid prediction of die temperature and heat flow.

Key Contributions:
- Parametric CFD simulations
- ROM development using MATLAB
- Thermal resistance and heat transfer coefficient extraction
- Instant thermal prediction without CFD

Results:
ROM predictions closely matched CFD trends across operating conditions.
